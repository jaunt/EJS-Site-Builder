#### Javascript powered static site generator. Fast, healthy, delicious.

## Design Philosophy

1. For maximum creativity, when you make a chance to the ingredients, your meal should be ready as fast as possible.
2. Avoid unnecessary site rebuilds like the plague.
3. Don't try to do too much and instead take advantage of existing tools. For example no assumptions are made about image processing or bundling. Use Vite!
4. Keep it simple.
