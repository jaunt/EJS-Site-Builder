# Templer

#### Minimalistic javascript powered site generator, full dependency tracking, fast updates.

## Design Constraints

1. Respond to template or data changes as fast as possible.
2. Avoid unnecessary site rebuilds like the plague with first class dependency tracking.
3. Don't add extra features that are already solved by other tools.
4. Take advantage of existing awesome dev tools like Vite.
5. Don't try to please everyone.
6. Express ourselves with javascript, not massive config files.

## Highlights

- Effecient Dependecy Tracking.
- Javascript EJS templating for performance and flexibilty.
- Designed to integrate with Vite.
- Designed to work with utilities like Tailwind.
- Designed to work with frameworks like AlpineJS.
- Functionally tested with the incredible [Clifry](https://github.com/jaunt/clifry).

## Documentation

[DOCS](https://templerdocs.netlify.app/)

Templer docs are made with Templer, Tailwind, and Vite, hosted on Netlify.

Apart from reading the docs, a great way to learn Templer is to explore the [Templer docs repository](https://github.com/jaunt/templerDocs), specifically the templer folder which generates the src folder which is processed by vite.
