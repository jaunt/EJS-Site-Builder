# Airfry

#### Typescript powered static site generator. Fast, healthy, delicious.

## The Crispy Commandments :doughnut:

1. Respond to template or data changes as fast as possible.
2. Avoid unnecessary site rebuilds like the plague with first class dependency tracking.
3. Keep it simple! Don't add extra features that are already solved.
4. Don't reinvent the wheel. Take advantage of existing awesome dev tools like Vite.
5. Have an opinion when it comes to workflow. Learn from the experience of seasoned and many-times-burned developers.
6. Express yourself with javascript, not massive config files.

## Main Features :fork_and_knife:

- Effecient Dependecy Tracking.
- Javascript EJS templating for performance and ease.
- Designed to integrate with Vite.
- Designed to work with Tailwind.
- Intended to optionally work seemlessly with progressive enhancement frameworks like AlpineJS or Petite Vue.
- Functionally tested with the incredible [Clifry](https://github.com/jaunt/clifry).

## Documentation  :fries:
[The documentation for Airfry](https://airfrydocs.netlify.app/) has been generated with Airfry with the help of Tailwind and Vite.  It's hosted on netlify:<br>

Apart from reading the docs, a great way to learn Airfy is to explore the [docs repository](https://github.com/jaunt/airfryDocs), specifically the airfry folder which generates the src folder which is processed by vite.
