## Documentation

[DOCS](https://ejssitebuilder.netlify.app/)

EjsSiteBuilder docs are made with EjsSiteBuilder, Tailwind, and Vite, hosted on Netlify.

Apart from reading the docs, a great way to learn EjsSiteBuilder is to explore the [EJS Site Builder docs repository](https://github.com/jaunt/EJS-Site-Builder-Docs), specifically the ejssitebuilder folder which generates the src folder which is processed by vite.
